## Hot-keys
`Esc and x` - closes window

`enter` or `space` - disables points adding and draws spline

`c` - clears points

`2` or `3` - sets spline degree

`j` and `k` - changes approximation iterations count

`w` - toggles curve wire-frame and user points

`s` - toggles spline line

`h` - toggles algorithm step lines

`r` - toggles algorithm collisions detection rectangles

`l` - draws only last approximating line

`o` - toggles open/closed spline


## De Casteljau
Draws a Bezier curve using De Casteljau algorithm of chosen degree

### Additional hot-keys
`i` and `o` - changes spline degree to demostrate spline degree lifting

## Approximating spline
Draws approximating open or closed spline of second or third degree.
